# ElevatorThreading

A M -story highrise has N elevators in a single "elevator bank", each able to serve every floor of the building. Contrary from most elevator designs, there are no buttons to choose a destination floor inside the elevator. Instead, the elevator lobby at each floor has M individual "destination floor" buttons, and passengers choose their destination by pushing the appropriate button. Once a button is pushed, a display near the buttons tells the passenger which elevator door to wait by.
